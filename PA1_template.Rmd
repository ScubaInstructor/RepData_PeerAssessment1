## Loading and preprocessing the data
* Load data file
```{r echo=TRUE}
fitdata <- read.csv("RepData_PeerAssessment1/activity.csv")
```

* Process data: steps~date
```{r echo=TRUE}
totalSteps <- aggregate(steps~date, data=fitdata, sum, na.rm=TRUE)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

mean(totalSteps$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
median(totalSteps$steps, na.rm = TRUE)

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
